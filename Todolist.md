    - import information into seperate collections of the same mongodb 

    

 Questions:

    1. With the csv files all containing different information, i have imported them as seperate collections. im not 100% sure how to direct different routes to specific collections
            is it to do with creating mongo clusters?

    2. am i able to search multiple collection? I have been trying whether sperating in multiple collections or having it all within one is the best option?
